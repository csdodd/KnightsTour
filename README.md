# Knights Tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

This is an implementation of Warnsdorff's rule in Kotlin to find any open or closed knights tour for any size grid.

## Example output:

Knights tour on a standard chess board
